# Getting Started

Welcome! To get started, run:

```
cd client/
npm i
npm start
cd ..
npm i
npm run dev
```

## Assumptions

- In the wireframe, the two example comments show "Thursday at 4pm" and "April 1st at 2pm". I was unclear whether these dates and times were rounded or exact. For the purpose of this exercise, I chose to display the exact date and time. However, with more conversation, I could have implemented a different date and time rendering.
